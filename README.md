ESP32 + e-ink screen for news and actionable insights

## Goals

### Overall
* I want to do a complete IoT project to learn how it's done
* I want to make something useful to me, and which doesn't trick me into engaging with it
* I want enough quality to turn this into a product if people like it

### Core Functionality
* I want it to show me insights about weather and train times or news from an RSS feed
* I want it to run for weeks off one 3400 mAh battery (that I can also charge through USB)
* I want it thin and light enough overall to hang up on a wall in a custom enclosure

## Design choices

* 7.5" E-ink display from WaveShare (possibly the 2-color option)
* ESP32 WiFi microcontroller (I have some around)

## Repository layout

This will most likely be a monorepo.
